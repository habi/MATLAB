  abstract = {Helical computed tomography (CT) is the most sensitive imaging modality
	for detection of pulmonary nodules. However, a single CT examination
	produces a large quantity of image data. Therefore, a computerized
	scheme has been developed to automatically detect pulmonary nodules
	on CT images. This scheme includes both two- and three-dimensional
	analyses. Within each section, gray-level thresholding methods are
	used to segment the thorax from the background and then the lungs
	from the thorax. A rolling ball algorithm is applied to the lung
	segmentation contours to avoid the loss of juxtapleural nodules.
	Multiple gray-level thresholds are applied to the volumetric lung
	regions to identify nodule candidates. These candidates represent
	both nodules and normal pulmonary structures. For each candidate,
	two- and three-dimensional geometric and gray-level features are
	computed. These features are merged with linear discriminant analysis
	to reduce the number of candidates that correspond to normal structures.
	This method was applied to a 17-case database. Receiver operating
	characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the automated
	classifier. Results yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.93 in
	the task of classifying candidates detected during thresholding as
	nodules or nonnodules.},

	means of quantitatively measuring regional lung structure and function.
	Abnormalities in lung ventilation due to alterations in airway function
	such as those observed in asthma and COPD are highly heterogeneous,
	and experimental methods to study this heterogeneity are crucial
	for better understanding of disease mechanisms and drug targeting
	strategies. In severe obstructive diseases requiring mechanical ventilation,
	the optimal ventilatory strategy to achieve recruitment of poorly
	ventilated lung zones remains a matter of considerable debate. We
	have used synchrotron radiation computed tomography (SRCT) for the
	in vivo study of regional lung ventilation and airway function. This
	imaging technique allows direct quantification of stable Xenon (Xe)
	gas used as an inhaled contrast agent using K-edge subtraction imaging.
	Dynamics of Xe wash-in can be used to calculate quantitative maps
	of regional specific lung ventilation. More recently, the development
	of Spiral-CT has allowed the acquisition of 3D images of the pulmonary
	bronchial tree and airspaces. This technique gives access to quantitative
	measurements of regional lung volume, ventilation, and mechanical
	properties. Examples of application in an experimental model of allergic
	asthma and in imaging lung recruitment as a function of mechanical
	ventilation parameters will be presented. The future orientations
	of this tecnique will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Studies of the origin of pulmonary blood flow heterogeneity have highlighted
	the significant role of vessel branching structure on flow distribution.
	To enable more detailed investigation of structure-function relationships
	in the pulmonary circulation, an anatomically based finite element
	model of the arterial and venous networks has been developed to more
	accurately reflect the geometry found in vivo. Geometric models of
	the arterial and venous tree structures are created using a combination
	of multidetector row X-ray computed tomography imaging to define
	around 2,500 vessels from each tree, a volume-filling branching algorithm
	to generate the remaining accompanying conducting vessels, and an
	empirically based algorithm to generate the supernumerary vessel
	geometry. The explicit generation of supernumerary vessels is a unique
	feature of the computational model. Analysis of branching properties
	and geometric parameters demonstrates close correlation between the
	model geometry and anatomical measures of human pulmonary blood vessels.
	A total of 12 Strahler orders for the arterial system and 10 Strahler
	orders for the venous system are generated, down to the equivalent
	level of the terminal bronchioles in the bronchial tree. A simple
	Poiseuille flow solution, assuming rigid vessels, is obtained within
	the arterial geometry of the left lung, demonstrating a large amount
	of heterogeneity in the flow distribution, especially with inclusion
	of supernumerary vessels. This model has been constructed to accurately
	represent available morphometric data derived from the complex asymmetric
	branching structure of the human pulmonary vasculature in a form
	that will be suitable for application in functional simulations.},

	a new generation technique that can encode near lossless ultrasound
	images at medium bit-rate with diagnostically acceptable quality.
	Because the coder of JPEG2000 is based on wavelet transform, the
	reconstructed image will contain some ringing artifacts. Some de-ringing
	algorithm must be applied to enhance image quality. This study presents
	quad-tree decomposition and a set of morphological filters for reducing

	morphological filters use eight predefined morphological operations,
	including four structuring elements (SE) that include both dilation

	morphological filter for each block to optimize decoded image quality.
	Image quality can be enhanced by applying the appropriate morphological
	filter to each block. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed

  abstract = {This study presents an automatic method for 3D reconstruction of vascular
	trees using computed-tomography angiographic (CTA) images. The program
	starts with the CTA slices, performs a sequential procedure of 3D
	image formation, preprocessing, segmentation, thinning, skeleton
	pruning and tree construction. It ends with vascular trees along
	with quantitative data about the trees such as values of diameter,
	length and bifurcation angles. All the involved algorithms are presented
	with the emphasis given to the skeleton pruning and tree construction
	algorithms. The skeletons obtained using a 3D thinning algorithm
	may contain cycles, spurs, isolated sticks, and non-unit-width parts,
	which hinder tree construction. As a solution to this problem, a
	skeleton pruning and tree construction algorithm is proposed. At
	each stage of the automatic procedure, 3D rendering is provided for
	visual inspection of the computed results. In the final output, the
	constructed vascular trees are visualized by rendering the 3D trees
	and the 3D binary image together in a transparent display mode. The
	program is carried out in a fully automatic fashion, with a few default
	settings. Occasionally, user intervention is needed at the 3D segmentation
	stage to impose an appropriate threshold when the automatic 3D segmentation
	is obviously sub-optimal for vessel delineation. Experimental demonstrations

  abstract = {The study of cerebral microvascular networks requires high-resolution
	images. However, to obtain statistically relevant results, a large
	area of the brain (several square millimeters) must be analyzed.
	This leads us to consider huge images, too large to be loaded and
	processed at once in the memory of a standard computer. To consider
	a large area, a compact representation of the vessels is required.
	The medial axis is the preferred tool for this application. To extract
	it, a dedicated skeletonization algorithm is proposed. Numerous approaches
	already exist which focus on computational efficiency. However, they
	all implicitly assume that the image can be completely processed
	in the computer memory, which is not realistic with the large images
	considered here. We present in this paper a skeletonization algorithm
	that processes data locally (in subimages) while preserving global
	properties (i.e., homotopy). We then show some results obtained on
	a mosaic of three-dimensional images acquired by confocal microscopy.},

  abstract = {Perforator flaps have been increasingly used in the past few years
	for trauma and reconstructive surgical cases. With the thinned flap
	design, greater survivability and a decrease in donor site morbidity
	have been reported. Knowledge of the 3D vascular tree will provide
	insight information about the dissection region, vascular territory,
	and fascia levels. In this paper, we will propose a computational
	framework for the automatic 3D vascular tree construction. The computational
	framework begins with an image segmentation algorithm, spedge-and-medge,
	which is an integration of Canny edge detector, edge-linking, and
	split-and-merge to initially segment out the vessels from the background.
	To deal with the possible broken vessels, a vascular cross-sectional
	tree repairing and interpolation algorithm is then developed based
	on the 3D connectivity and root-converging properties of the tree
	branches. Furthermore, to extract the essential characteristics of
	the vascular structure, 3D thinning algorithms are used to build
	up the skeletons of the tree. At each stage of the framework, 3D
	rendering results are provided for the visualization of the computed
	results. The proposed method achieves good performance and has been
	used for the 3D vascular tree construction and surgical danger zone
	measurements on 39 harvested cadaver perforator flaps with the types
	of ALTP, GAP, and TAP.},

	by airflow limitation caused by emphysema and/or airway narrowing.
	Computed tomography has been widely used to assess emphysema severity,
	but less attention has been paid to the assessment of airway disease
	using computed tomography. Objectives: To obtain longitudinal images
	and accurately analyze short axis images of airways with an inner
	diameter [&gt;=] 2 mm located anywhere in the lung with new software
	for measuring airway dimensions using curved multiplanar reconstruction.
	Methods: In 52 patients with clinically stable COPD (stage I, 14;
	stage II, 22; stage III, 14; stage IV, 2), we used the software to
	analyze the relationship of the airflow limitation index (FEV1, %
	predicted) with the airway dimensions from the third to the sixth
	generations of the apical bronchus (B1) of the right upper lobe and
	the anterior basal bronchus (B8) of the right lower lobe. Measurements
	and Main Results: Airway luminal area (Ai) and wall area percent
	(WA%) were significantly correlated with FEV1 (% predicted). More
	importantly, the correlation coefficients (r) improved as the airways
	became smaller in size from the third (segmental) to sixth generations
	in both bronchi (Ai: r = 0.26, 0.37, 0.58, and 0.64 for B1; r = 0.60,
	0.65, 0.63, and 0.73 for B8). Conclusions: We are the first to use
	three-dimensional computed tomography to demonstrate that airflow
	limitation in COPD is more closely related to the dimensions of the
	distal (small) airways than proximal (large) airways.},

	that are associated with alterations of the vascular system in organs.
	Ex vivo imaging of large vascular networks became feasible with recent
	developments in microcomputed tomography ([mu]CT). Current methods
	permit to visualize only limited numbers of physically excised regions
	of interests (ROIs) from larger samples. We developed a method based
	on modified vascular corrosion casting (VCC), scanning electron microscopy
	(SEM), and desktop and synchrotron radiation [mu]CT (SR[mu]CT) technologies
	to image vasculature at increasing levels of resolution, also referred
	to as hierarchical imaging. This novel approach allows nondestructive
	3D visualization and quantification of large microvascular networks,
	while retaining a precise anatomical context for ROIs scanned at
	very high resolution. Scans of entire mouse brain VCCs were performed
	at 16-[mu]m resolution with a desktop [mu]CT system. Custom-made
	navigation software with a ROI selection tool enabled the identification
	of anatomical brain structures and precise placement of multiple
	ROIs. These were then scanned at 1.4-[mu]m voxel size using SR[mu]CT
	and a local tomography setup. A framework was developed for fast
	sample positioning, precise selection of ROIs, and sequential high-throughput
	scanning of a large numbers of brain VCCs. Despite the use of local
	tomography, exceptional image quality was achieved with SR[mu]CT.
	This method enables qualitative and quantitative assessment of vasculature
	at unprecedented resolution and volume with relatively high throughput,
	opening new possibilities to study vessel architecture and vascular
	alterations in models of disease},

	by assuming a geometric shape and counting alveolar profiles in single,
	independent sections. In this study, we used the unbiased disector
	principle to estimate the Euler characteristic (and thereby the number)
	of alveolar openings in rat lungs and rhesus monkey lung lobes and
	to obtain robust estimates of average alveolar volume. The estimator
	of total alveolar number was based on systematic, uniformly random
	sampling using the fractionator sampling design. The number of alveoli
	in the rat lung ranged from 17.3 x 10(6) to 24.6 x 10(6), with a
	mean of 20.1 x 10(6). The average number of alveoli in the two left
	lung lobes in the monkey ranged from 48.8 x 10(6) to 67.1 x 10(6)
	with a mean of 57.7 x 10(6). The coefficient of error due to stereological
	sampling was of the order of 0.06 in both rats and monkeys and the
	biological variation (coefficient of variance between individuals)
	was 0.15 in rat and 0.13 in monkey (left lobe, only). Between subdivisions
	(left/right in rat and cranial/caudal in monkey) there was an increase
	in variation, most markedly in the rat. With age (2-13 years) the
	alveolar volume increased 3-fold (as did parenchymal volume) in monkeys,
	but the alveolar number was unchanged. This study illustrates that
	use of the Euler characteristic and fractionator sampling is a robust
	and efficient, unbiased principle for the estimation of total alveolar
	number in the lung or in well-defined parts of it.},

  journal = {Coral Reefs},

  pages = {--},
  abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Morphological variation in marine sessile organisms
	is frequently related to environmental factors. Quantifying such
	variation is relevant in a range of ecological studies. For example,
	analyzing the growth form of fossil organisms may indicate the state
	of the physical environment in which the organism lived. A quantitative
	morphological comparison is important in studies where marine sessile
	organisms are transplanted from one environment to another. This
	study presents a method for the quantitative analysis of three-dimensional
	(3D) images of scleractinian corals obtained with X-ray Computed
	Tomography scanning techniques. The advantage of Computed Tomography
	scanning is that a full 3D image of a complex branching object, including
	internal structures, can be obtained with a very high precision.
	There are several complications in the analysis of this data set.
	In the analysis of a complex branching object, landmark-based methods
	usually do not work and different approaches are required where various
	artifacts (for example cavities, holes in the skeleton, scanning
	artifacts, etc.) in the data set have to be removed before the analysis.
	A method is presented, which is based on the construction of a medial
	axis and a combination of image-processing techniques for the analysis
	of a 3D image of a complex branching object where the complications
	mentioned above can be overcome. The method is tested on a range
	of 3D images of samples of the branching scleractinian coral Madracis
	mirabilis collected at different depths. It is demonstrated that
	the morphological variation of these samples can be quantified, and
	that biologically relevant morphological characteristics, like branch-spacing
	and surface/volume ratios, can be computed.},

	Texture analysis was performed using morphological features, analogous

	BMd measurements of the hip (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were
	obtained in all patients. Significant differences between both patient
	groups were obtained using morphological parameters and fractal dimension
	as well as hip BMD (p < 0.05). Odds ratios for the texture parameters
	apparent (app.) bone volume/total volume and app. trabecular separation

	cylindrical human transiliac bone specimens were obtained post mortem
	from 27 women and 36 men (age 23-92 years) and evaluated morphometrically

	in the mediolateral plane of the bone cores. The sections were stained
	with the von Kossa technique to obtain high-contrast two-dimensional
	images. Prior to the histologic sectioning the samples were measured
	with a desktop [mu]CT, providing a 14 [mu]m nominal resolution. The
	morphometric parameters computed by both methods in two or three
	dimensions, respectively, were bone volume density (BV/TV), bone
	surface density (BS/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and trabecular

	The mean percentage differences between histology and [mu]CT ranged

	histomorphometric and micro-tomographic analysis are very promising
	for the use of micro-tomographic imaging. [mu]CT is a nondestructive,

	A design-based stereologic approach was used for the direct and unbiased
	estimation of alveolar number in the human lung. The principle is
	based on two-dimensional topology in three-dimensional space and
	is free of assumptions on the shape, size, or spatial orientation
	of alveoli. Alveolar number is estimated by counting their openings
	at the level of the free septal edges, where they form a two-dimensional
	network. Mathematically, the Euler number of this network is estimated
	using physical disectors at a light microscopic level. In six adult
	human lungs, the mean alveolar number was 480 million (range: 274-790
	million; coefficient of variation: 37\%). Alveolar number was closely
	related to total lung volume, with larger lungs having considerably
	more alveoli. The mean size of a single alveolus was rather constant
	with 4.2 x 10(6) microm3 (range: 3.3-4.8 x 10(6) microm3; coefficient
	of variation: 10\%), irrespective of the lung size. One cubic millimeter
	lung parenchyma would then contain around 170 alveoli. The method
	proved to be very efficient and easy to apply in practice. Future
	applications will show this approach to be an important addition
	to design-based stereologic methods for the quantitative analysis
	of lung structure.},

	postnatal week. Speculating that programmed cell death may contribute
	to the thinning of the alveolar septa, we searched for the presence
	of DNA fragmentation in rat lungs between postnatal days 6 and 36
	using the TUNEL procedure, The number of positive nuclei was compared
	at different days. We observed an 8-fold increase of programmed cell
	death toward the end of the third week as compared to the days before
	and after this time point. The precise timing of the appearance of
	the peak depended on the size of the litter, Double-labeling for
	DNA fragmentation (TUNEL) and for type I and type II epithelial cells
	(antibodies E11 and MNF-116), as well as morphologic studies at electron
	microscopic level, revealed that during the peak of programmed cell
	death mainly fibroblasts and type II epithelial cells were dying.
	While both dying cell types were TUNEL-positive. nuclear fragments
	and apoptotic bodies were exclusively observed in the dying fibroblasts.
	We conclude that programmed cell death is involved in the structural
	maturation of the lung by reducing the number of fibroblasts and
	type II epithelial cells in the third postnatal week, We observed
	that the dying fibroblasts are cleared by neighboring fibroblasts
	in a later stage of apoptosis, and we hypothesize that type II epithelial
	cells are cleared by alveolar macrophages in early stages of the

	early to late gestation in fetal pigs and rabbits and in cultured
	fetal mouse lungs. Propagating waves of contraction traveling proximal
	to distal were observed in fresh lungs throughout gestation which
	displaced the lung liquid along the lumen. In the pseudoglandular
	and canalicular stages (fetal pigs) the frequency ranged from 2.3
	to 3.3 contractions/min with a 39 to 46\% maximum reduction of lumen
	diameter. In the saccular stage (rabbit) the frequency was 10 to
	12/min with a narrowing of approximately 30\%. In the organ cultures
	the waves of narrowing started at the trachea in whole lungs, or
	at the main bronchus in lobes (5.2 +/- 1.5 contractions/min, 22 +/-
	8\% reduction of lumen diameter), and as they proceeded distally
	along the epithelial tubes the luminal liquid was shifted toward
	the terminal tubules, which expanded the endbuds. As the tubules
	relaxed the flow of liquid was reversed. Thus the behavior of airway
	smooth muscle in the fetal lung is phasic in type (like gastrointestinal
	muscle) in contrast to that in postnatal lung, where it is tonic.
	An intraluminal positive pressure of 2.33 +/- 0.77 cm H(2)O was recorded
	in rabbit fetal trachea. It is proposed that the active tone of the
	smooth muscle maintains the positive intraluminal pressure and acts
	as a stimulus to lung growth via the force exerted across the airway
	wall and adjacent parenchyma. The expansion of the compliant endbuds
	by the fluid shifts at the airway tip may promote their growth into
	the surrounding mesenchyme.},

	During the first 3 wk of life the role of tissue transglutaminase

	In large blood vessels and large airways, which mature earlier than

	is generated. Based on computed tomography (CT) scans, the following
	steps are performed. 1) The volume data is preprocessed and the vessels

	into a graph enabling a geometrical and structural shape analysis.
	Using this information the different intrahepatic vessel systems
	are identified automatically. 3) Based on the structural analysis
	of the branches of the portal vein, their vascular territories are
	approximated with different methods. These methods are compared and
	validated anatomically by means of corrosion casts of human livers.
	4) Vessels are visualized with graphics primitives fitted to the

  abstract = {Dry snow slab avalanche release is preceded by two fracture mechanical
	processes: shear failure of a weak layer or an interface within the
	snowpack, followed by tensile failure of the overlaying slab. For
	a slope stability analysis based on fracture mechanics, the fracture
	toughness of snow has to be known. The purpose of this work was to
	evaluate snow fracture toughness in mode 1, to determine to what
	extent it is affected by the specimen size and shape and to search
	for adequate correction methods. Edge-cracked beam-shaped snow specimens
	cut from homogeneous layers of naturally deposited snow were subjected
	to three-point bending and cantilever beam tests. To describe the
	size dependence an empirical size effect law and the FAD (failure
	assessment diagram) approach were explored. By comparing the three-point
	bending with the cantilever beam tests a shape dependence of the
	toughness was found. The fracture process zone was estimated to be
	in the order of at least one centimetre. Due to the large size of
	the fracture process zone a dependence of the toughness on the specimen
	size has to be expected, as it is typical for non-linear, quasi-brittle
	materials. Experiments with four different specimen sizes clearly
	confirmed that toughness is size dependent, possibly up to the scale
	of a slab avalanche. Preliminary results suggest that the actual
	fracture toughness might be twice as large as the one determined
	experimentally. Therefore, size correction functions will be essential
	to transform toughness data of laboratory-scaled experiments to the
	scale relevant for snow slope stability models. (c) 2005 Elsevier

  abstract = {The morphology and morphometric data of collagen and elastin fibers
	in the pulmonary alveolar walls are presented. Specimens were obtained
	from postmortem lungs quick-frozen at specified transpulmonary pressures.
	Collagen was stained by silver, and elastin was stained by orcein.
	Photomicrographs were composed by computer. Young lungs typically
	show small collagen fibers that radiate from the "posts," whereas
	larger fiber bundles traverse the septum irrespective of capillary
	blood vessels. In older lungs, rings of collagen around the posts
	appear enlarged. Elastin bundles do not show obvious variation in
	pattern with age and inflation pressure. Statistical frequency distributions
	of the fiber width and curvature are both skewed, but the square
	root of the width and the cube root of the curvature have approximate
	normal distributions. Typically, for young lungs at transpulmonary
	pressure of 4 cmH2O, the mean of (width)1/2 (in micron1/2) for collagen
	fibers is 0.952 +/- 0.242 (SD), that of (curvature)1/3 (in micron-1/3)
	is 0.349 +/- 0.094. The corresponding values for elastin are 0.986
	+/- 0.255 and 0.395 +/- 0.094.},

  abstract = {Bone microarchitecture is believed to play a key role in determining
	bone quality. We therefore present a new method for the volumetric
	spatial decomposition of trabecular bone samples into its basic elements
	(rods and plates). This new method is a framework for the element
	based description of bone microarchitecture. First, the newly developed
	algorithm was validated on computer-generated models. Then, it was
	applied to 328 human trabecular bone samples harvested from 70 donors
	at five different anatomical sites (calcaneus, femoral head, iliac
	crest, lumbar spine 2 and 4), which were previously scanned by microcomputed
	tomography. Standard three-dimensional morphometric algorithms were
	used to analyze the trabeculae on an individual basis with respect
	to their volume, surface, and thickness. The results were statistically
	compared for the five sites. In this study, it was possible for the
	first time to spatially decompose trabecular bone structures in its
	volumetric elements; rods and plates. The size of the largest element
	in the structures showed significant differences for the five compared
	sites. In samples from femoral head, we found that basically one
	"major element" was spanning through the whole structure whereas
	in lumbar spine and calcaneus, smaller elements dominate. From this,
	we suggest that the strength of strong, dense plate-like structures
	is determined by the major elements whereas in looser rod-like structures
	the strength is given by the arrangement, quality, and shape of a
	whole set of elements. Furthermore, we found that globally determined
	structural indices such as the mean curvature of the bone surface
	(<H>) or related to this the structure model index (SMI) are almost
	exclusively explained by the arrangement of the plates. This also
	suggests that rods hold independent information characterizing trabecular
	bone quality, especially in the spine. These findings may improve
	the understanding of the site-specific role of bone microarchitecture
	in determining bone quality and in future studies the competence
	of bone.},

  abstract = {Defining the healthy human airway is important in enhancing our understanding

	structure of the human airway, both static and dynamic, can be assessed
	using multi-detector CT (MDCT) scanning. This modality also allows
	for the evaluation of structures outside of the airway. The airway
	wall can be directly visualized using CCD chip high-resolution color
	optical imaging through endoscopy allowing bronchial wall evaluation
	by traditional biopsy methods, as well as by newer optically based
	strategies. We suggest that these two imaging modalities, MDCT and
	optical imaging, provide complementary information about the normal
	airway, and the airway in various diseases. Methods for evaluating
	the human airway using MDCT images are presented facilitating automatic
	airway segmentation, branchpoint finding and airway dimension analysis.
	The airway wall color is objectively evaluated as an important surrogate
	for airway wall inflammation and cancer formation, and the integration
	of the color endoscopic information into the MDCT scan data set is
	currently ongoing. The amalgamation of these two digital imaging
	modalities appears increasingly useful for enabling biopsy techniques,

  abstract = {The application of x-ray flat panel imagers (FPIs) in cone beam volume
	CT (CBVCT) has attracted increasing attention. However, due to a
	deficient semiconductor array manufacturing process, defective cells
	unavoidably exist in x-ray FPIs. These defective cells cause their
	corresponding image pixels in a projection image to behave abnormally
	in signal gray level, and result in severe streak and ring artifacts
	in a CBVCT image reconstructed from the projection images. Since
	a three-dimensional (3-D) back-projection is involved in CBVCT, the
	formation of the streak and ring artifacts is different from that
	in the two-dimensional (2-D) fan beam CT. In this paper, a geometric
	analysis of the abnormality propagation in the 3D back-projection
	is presented, and the morphology of the streak and ring artifacts
	caused by the abnormality propagation is investigated through both
	computer simulation and phantom studies. In order to calibrate those
	artifacts, a 2D wavelet-analysis-based statistical approach to correct
	the abnormal pixels is proposed. The approach consists of three steps:
	(1) the location-invariant defective cells in an x-ray FPI are recognized
	by applying 2-D wavelet analysis on flat-field images, and a comprehensive
	defective cell template is acquired; (2) based upon the template,
	the abnormal signal gray level of the projection image pixels corresponding
	to the location-invariant defective cells is replaced with the interpolation
	of that of their normal neighbor pixels; (3) that corresponding to
	the isolated location-variant defective cells are corrected using
	a narrow-windowed median filter. The CBVCT images of a CT low-contrast
	phantom are employed to evaluate this proposed approach, showing
	that the streak and ring artifacts can be reliably eliminated. The
	novelty and merit of the approach are the incorporation of the wavelet
	analysis whose intrinsic multi-resolution analysis and localizability
	make the recognition algorithm robust under variable x-ray exposure
	levels between 30% and 70% of the dynamic range of an x-ray FPI},

	By automatically counting the number of points and measuring the

	There are, however, many controversies regarding the adverse side

	In rats, glucocorticoids are known to seriously impair the formation
	of alveoli when applied during the first two postnatal weeks even

	long-term glucocorticoid effects on the rat lung by means of morphologic

	Application of a high-dosage protocol for only few days resulted
	in a marked acceleration of lung development with a precocious microvascular
	maturation resulting in single capillary network septa in the first
	4 postnatal days. By postnatal d 10, the lung morphologic phenotype
	showed a step back in the maturational state, with an increased number
	of septa with double capillary layer, followed by an exceptional
	second round of the alveolarization process. As a result of this
	process, there was an almost complete recovery in the parenchymal
	lung structure by postnatal d 36, and by d 60, there were virtually
	no qualitative or quantitative differences between experimental and
	control rats. These findings indicate that both dosage and duration
	of glucocorticoid therapy in the early postnatal period are very
	critical with respect to lung development and maturation and that
	a careful therapeutic strategy can minimize late sequelae of treatment.},

  abstract = {The alveolated structure of the pulmonary acinus plays a vital role
	in gas exchange function. Three-dimensional (3D) analysis of the
	parenchymal region is fundamental to understanding this structure-function
	relationship, but only a limited number of attempts have been conducted
	in the past because of technical limitations. In this study, we developed
	a new image processing methodology based on finite element (FE) analysis
	for accurate 3D structural reconstruction of the gas exchange regions
	of the lung. Stereologically well characterized rat lung samples
	(Pediatr Res 53: 72-80, 2003) were imaged using high-resolution synchrotron
	radiation-based X-ray tomographic microscopy. A stack of 1,024 images
	(each slice: 1024 x 1024 pixels) with resolution of 1.4 {micro}m3
	per voxel were generated. For the development of FE algorithm, regions
	of interest (ROI), containing [~]7.5 million voxels, were further
	extracted as a working subunit. 3D FEs were created overlaying the
	voxel map using a grid-based hexahedral algorithm. A proper threshold
	value for appropriate segmentation was iteratively determined to
	match the calculated volume density of tissue to the stereologically
	determined value (Pediatr Res 53: 72-80, 2003). The resulting 3D
	FEs are ready to be used for 3D structural analysis as well as for
	subsequent FE computational analyses like fluid dynamics and skeletonization.},

	lung has been grounded in dispersive theories based on untested assumptions
	about the nature of acinar airflow fields. Traditionally, these have
	been taken to be simple and kinematically reversible. In this article,
	we apply the recently discovered fluid mechanical phenomenon of irreversible
	low-Reynolds number flow to the lung. We demonstrate, through flow
	visualization studies in rhythmically ventilated rat lungs, that
	such a foundation is false, and that chaotic mixing may be key to
	aerosol transport. We found substantial alveolar flow irreversibility
	with stretched and folded fractal patterns, which lead to a sudden
	increase in mixing. These findings support our theory that chaotic
	alveolar flow-characterized by stagnation saddle points associated
	with alveolar vortices-governs gas kinematics in the lung periphery,
	and hence the transport, mixing, and ultimately the deposition of
	fine aerosols. This mechanism calls for a rethinking of the relationship
	of exposure and deposition of fine inhaled particles},

  abstract = {Stereological tools are the gold standard for accurate (i.e., unbiased)
	and precise quantification of any microscopic sample. The past decades
	have provided a broad spectrum of tools to estimate a variety of
	parameters such as volumes, surfaces, lengths, and numbers. Some
	of them require pairs of parallel sections that can be produced by
	either physical or optical sectioning, with optical sectioning being
	much more efficient when applicable. Unfortunately, transmission
	electron microscopy could not fully profit from these riches, mainly
	because of the large depth of field. Hence, optical sectioning was
	a long-time desire for electron microscopists. This desire was fulfilled
	with the development of electron tomography that yield stacks of
	slices from electron microscopic sections. Now, parallel optical
	slices of a previously unimagined small thickness (2-5 nm axial resolution)
	can be produced. These optical slices minimize problems related to
	overprojection effects, and allow for direct stereological analysis,
	e.g., volume estimation with the Cavalieri principle and number estimation
	with the optical disector method. Here, we demonstrate that the symbiosis
	of stereology and electron tomography is an easy and efficient way
	for quantitative analysis at the electron microscopic level. We call
	this approach quantitative 3D electron microscopy.},
